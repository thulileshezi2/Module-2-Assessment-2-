           <h3>CHECKERS</h3>

            <p>Checkers is a game played on a board checkered with squares of two colors. Two players compete in checkers to have the last piece on the board. ... Players 
                move diagonally on the board, trying to reach the opposite side where their pieces can be "kinged,"
                 or doubled, giving them more powers.</p>
                 <p>Our efforts in developing products, services and experiences that people love have made the Checkers brand relevant after almost a century of serving the Southern African market. From our much loved steakhouse classics, to our ever-expanding cellar of local and international wines, to our extensive range of award-winning cheeses: we’re proud to be the supermarket of choice for shoppers who enjoy the finer things.
                    But it doesn’t stop there; we make sure every shopper enjoys value for their money by keeping the prices of basic commodities low. In fact, we’ve consistently gone beyond the retail status quo when our customers needed us. When bread prices spiralled out of control in 1990, for example, 
                    we immediately stepped in and subsidised the sale of every loaf of bread at our stores.
                    Millions of South Africans also enjoy more value for their rand with campaigns like “Trolley for trolley, you won’t pay more at Checkers” and others that routinely slash basic commodity prices for lower income shoppers. These and countless initiatives over the years have earned the Checkers brand a reputation for trust, quality and reliability in times of uncertainty.</p>

         <p>We’re always learning how to be a better retailer for you. When Checkers founder, Norman Hertz Herber, cut the ribbon on our first store in Mayfair, it was the culmination of years of learning from what leading retailers all over the world were doing at the time. He also knew the Mayfair store was to be the start of a long road ahead that would see the Checkers brand continually push beyond possible.
            We think Norman’s set the bar sufficiently high, and it is in that spirit that we continue the tradition of innovation, customer excellence and products and services that delight. And for us, that’s what it means to be better and better.</p>
